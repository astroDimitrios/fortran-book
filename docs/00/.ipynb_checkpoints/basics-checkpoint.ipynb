    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran files have the extension **.f90** [^1] and begin with the `program` keyword. They end with the corresponding `end program` keywords. It is good practice to label your program, for instance below is a Fortran program called ***hello_world*** inside the file ***hello_world.f90***.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Fortran files can have other [extensions](https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/File+extensions), **.f90** is used to denote free-form Fortran which removed fixed form restrictions such as the line width being constrained to 72 columns, for more see [Free vs. Fixed Format](). Fixed form Fortran is denoted by the **.f** and **.for** extensions. If a Fortran file requires preprocessing use a capital F in the extension, **.F90**. For more see the [preprocessing section]() of this book. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{eval-rst}\n",
    ".. literalinclude:: src/hello_world.f90\n",
    "   :language: fortran\n",
    "   :caption: hello_world.f90\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran is case ***insensitive***, this book will use lowercase as part of its [style](). Notice the indented `print` keyword, the Fortran standard doesn't include tabs so the indentation is four spaces for each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compiling\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran is a compiled language. To compile our ***hello_world.f90*** program we can use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "::::{margin} \n",
    ":::{admonition} Interactives\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "The interactives in this book do not require the usual `program` or `end program` keywords and are compiled automatically by [LFortran]().\n",
    ":::\n",
    "::::\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{tab-set}\n",
    "````{tab-item} gfortran\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "gfortran -o hello hello_world.f90\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "````{tab-item} ifort\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "ifort -o hello hello_world.f90\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "And to run our program from the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{tab-set}\n",
    "````{tab-item} Linux\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "> ./hello\n",
    "Hello World!\n",

    "Cards like the one below describe your next exercise and are normally followed by a solution card. These exercises are intended to be coded on your local machine and compiled. Have a go at your first exercise, building the hello world program and running it.\n",

    "For this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that you have a Fortran compiler present on your system\n",
    "- Create the file ***hello_world.f90***\n",
    "- Copy the ***hello_world.f90*** program from above\n",
    "- Compile and run the program\n",

    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments in Fortran are declared with an `!`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "! This is a comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the exercises in this book make sure you comment your code! Generating full documentation for your code will be explored in the [Doxygen]() section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five types in Fortran. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|     Type     |        example       |\n",
    "| ------------ | -------------------- |\n",
    "| integer      | `1`                  |\n",
    "| real (float) | `1.0` or `1.2d-11`   |\n",
    "| character    | `'text'`             |\n",
    "| complex      | `( 1.0, 1.0 )`       |\n",
    "| logical      | `.true.` or `.false` |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaring Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be declared using the `::` syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "integer :: i, j        ! simple counters for looping\n",
    "real    :: my_height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we declared two integer variables, then a real variable. Notice how the `::` are aligned for readability. Variables names can contain letters, numbers, and `_` only. They must start with a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### implicit none\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran assumes that the single character variables i through n will be used for counting during loops and automatically declares them as integer types. It is good practice in modern Fortran to declare `implicit none` at the start of all programs, modules, functions, and subroutines to supress this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assigning Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be assigned when they are declared however it is best practice to assign a value with a new statement for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "integer :: i, j        ! simple counters for looping\n",
    "real    :: my_height\n",
    "\n",
    "i         = 0\n",
    "my-height = 54.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters are variables with a fixed value that cannot be changed. Parameters must be declared with their value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "real                    :: earth_radius = 6371000\n",
    "character(*), parameter :: earth_radius_unit = 'm'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often used, as in the example above, for physical constants.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Character Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters are declared with a length variable. This allocates the correct amount of memory for the string length. If the string is shorter than the declared length it will be padded with spaces. If the string is longer than the declared length it will be cut to the declared length.\n",
    "\n",
    "::::{margin} \n",
    ":::{admonition} trim()\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "When printing a character type the `trim()` command will remove any trailing whitespaces.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "::::\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition interactive\">\n",
