    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five types in Fortran. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|     Type     |        example       |\n",
    "| ------------ | -------------------- |\n",
    "| integer      | `1`                  |\n",
    "| real (float) | `1.0` or `1.2d-11`   |\n",
    "| character    | `'text'`             |\n",
    "| complex      | `( 1.0, 1.0 )`       |\n",
    "| logical      | `.true.` or `.false` |\n",

    "## Declaring Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be declared using the `::` syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "integer :: i, j        ! simple counters for looping\n",
    "real    :: my_height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we declared two integer variables, then a real variable. Notice how the `::` are aligned for readability. Variables names can contain letters, numbers, and `_` only. They must start with a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### implicit none\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran assumes that the single character variables i through n will be used for counting during loops and automatically declares them as integer types. It is good practice in modern Fortran to declare `implicit none` at the start of all programs, modules, functions, and subroutines to supress this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assigning Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be assigned when they are declared however it is best practice to assign a value with a new statement for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "integer :: i, j        ! simple counters for looping\n",
    "real    :: my_height\n",
    "\n",
    "i         = 0\n",
    "my-height = 54.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    ":name: assigning-vars\n",
    "Always ensure variables are assinged a value. If a variable is delcared and referenced but not assigned unexpected behaviour can occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "real :: y\n",
    "print *, y\n",
    "! gfortran prints 4.56472975E-41\n",
    "! ifort prints 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the gfortran compiler printed what was already in the memory it assigned for y, whereas the ifort compiler set the value to zero.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters are variables with a fixed value that cannot be changed. Parameters must be declared with their value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "real                    :: earth_radius = 6371000\n",
    "character(*), parameter :: earth_radius_unit = 'm'\n",
    "```\n",

    "They are often used, as in the example above, for physical constants.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    ":name: constants-pi\n",
    "Fortran doesn't have any built in constants such as $e$ or $\\pi$. To calculate these constants use:\n",

    "## Kinds\n",
    "\n",
    "The default precision for real numbers in Fortran is ***single*** precision (sp). You should take care when declaring any number to specify a kind (precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare the precision of a number using `kind`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    " ! hardware specific 32 bit real (sp)\n",
    "integer, parameter :: r_32 = selected_real_kind(6, 37)\n",
    "! hardware specific 64 bit real\n",
    "integer, parameter :: r_64 = selected_real_kind(15, 307)\n",
    "\n",
    "! kind can be ommitted but this is not recommended\n",
    "real(r_32)      :: height\n",
    "real(kind=r_64) :: earth_radius = 6371229.0_r_64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we defined our precisions as integer parameters to initialise our real numbers with. The real variable `height` is single precision whereas the real variable `earth_radius` is double precision (dp). Notice that we also assigned a number to `eath_radius` when we delcared it. This number ends in `_r_64` denoting it is a double precision real number. Without this Fortran will assign the number as single **not** double precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways to declare the precision of a variable, you may see: `3.14d0` instead of `3.14_r_64` to denote double precision. You may also see kinds declared in byte units: `REAL*8`, this does not conform to the Fortran standard and should not be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where possible avoid using `d` and follow the example above to declare a variables kind.You may also see use of the intrinsic Fortran module **iso_fortran_env**. Kinds are declared with this module as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "! module use statement\n",
    "use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: int64, real64, real128\n",
    "\n",
    "integer, parameter :: i_64  = int64\n",
    "integer, parameter :: r_64  = real64\n",
    "integer, parameter :: r_128 = real128\n",
    "\n",
    "real(kind=r_64)    :: x = 1.0_r_64\n",
    "real(kind=r_64)    :: y\n",
    "y = 1.0       ! single precision\n",
    "y = 1.0_r_64  ! double precision\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this snippet three kinds: a 64 bit integer, a 64 bit real, and a 128 bit real, were loaded. Again note the warning about assingning a double precision value to a declared variable. The use of intrinisc modules and how to create your own is dealt with in the [!!!!!!!!!!]() section.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    ":name: char-kind\n",
    "For character types the kind must precede the string and the kind relates to the character set used. This will not be explored further in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "integer, parameter         :: ck = kind('A')\n",

    "\n",
    "This list may seem long but as you write more Fortran code they will become part of your standard practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DO ensure all real values have the correct kind declared\n",
    "- DO assign high precision constants \n",
    "- DO assign dp variables with a kind such as `r_64`, eg. `3.14_r_64`\n",
    "- DO use a module to store your kind declarations, see good practice in [constants_mod.f90]()\n",

    "- Avoid using compiler flags to set default precision, set explicitly using kinds\n",
    "- Avoid mixing types in arithmetic\n",

    "### Converting Types & Kinds\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting between kinds is possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",

    "### Overflow and Underflow\n",
    "\n",
    "If a number becomes so large it cannot be represented anymore by your chosen kind then you have overflow and vice versa for underflow. To see the largest and smallest numbers a kind can represent use the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "epsilon(x) ! 1.19209290E-07, effectively negligible number for x's kind\n",
    "huge(x)    ! 3.40282347E+38, largest number\n",
    "tiny(x)    ! 1.17549435E-38, smallest number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `x` is a double precision real and the example output, printed using `print *, tiny(x)` for instance, is for a typical 64 bit linux machine. To test for overflow `huge(x)` can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "if ( real1 <= huge(real1) ) then\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "else\n",
    "    error stop 'Overflow'\n",
