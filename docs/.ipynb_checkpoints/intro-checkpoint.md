# Introduction to Fortran

by Team.

This book is designed to introduce you to the basics of modern [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/en/) and good software engineering practices.
It is heavily inspired by the work of Katherine Holcomb {cite}`holcomb`.

Fortran was created in 1957 by a team at IBM and excels with numerically intensive science code.
Far from the punchcards, and fixed-form formatting of Fortrans early days, modern Fortran is fast, 
and since the Fortran 2018 update natively parallel. It is often used to write numerical code for 
High Performance Computing (HPC). 

## Getting Started

The first few lessons in this book won't require you to have fortran installed locally. Through the power of the open-source projects Jupyter and LFortran you can run Fortran in the browser.
